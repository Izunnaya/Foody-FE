// This is the where we will create the code that uses the SDK to connect to our Auth0 acct we created.

// ****KEY THINGS TO KNOW HERE

//The "appState"  parameter passed into onRedirectCallback is what will hold information about the url path where the user was before they tried using Auth0. If a route where they are meant to go is not specified, the user is authomatically rerouted to the page where they were before the login/sign Up happened

//Example: If the user tried to access /cart before logging in, appState remembers /cart to send them back there.

// user (optional): This parameter is optional, but it contains the authenticated userâ€™s data (email, name, etc.).
// We need the users info as we will be using some part of it to display to the frontend and also the information to store in the backend
