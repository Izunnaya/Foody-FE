#  Foody – MERN Food Ordering App
Foody is an ongoing full-stack food ordering web application built to deepen my backend skills using the MERN stack. It allows users to browse menus, manage cart items, and securely place orders. The project demonstrates real-world use of REST APIs, modular architecture, and backend integration with authentication.
## Features
- Browse food items by category

- Add and remove items from the cart

- User registration and login

- Place and track orders (in progress)

- Backend with REST APIs using Express
